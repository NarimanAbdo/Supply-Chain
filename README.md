# Business Task:
1. Analyzing shipment performance across different regions and shipment modes.
2. What is the average order fulfillment time, and how does it impact overall warehouse performance?
3. Understanding the impact of seasonality on sales and profitability is important to better prepare for demand fluctuations.
# Insights:
## Warehouse Delays:
Departments need more time for order fulfillment, with completion times ranging from 4 to 7 days, which impacts delivery timelines.

 * Same Day: 18% of orders are delayed (1-2 days average).
 * Second Class: 51% of orders are delayed (3-4 days average).

# Recommendations: 
## Optimize Shipment Modes
* Standardize shipment modes for specific orders to improve consistency in delivery times.
* Explore partnerships with reliable carriers to ensure quicker and more consistent shipping options.
## Enhance Fulfillment Processes:
* Streamline internal processes to reduce order processing times, such as implementing better inventory management systems.
* Consider automating parts of the fulfillment process to reduce manual errors and speed up processing.
## Monitor and Adapt
* Continuously monitor fulfillment performance metrics and gather customer feedback to adapt strategies.
* Review and analyze shipping data to identify patterns and make data-driven adjustments.
## Warehouse construction
* France and Germany are both our biggest sales and profit-generating countries. So, consider building a new warehouse in Europe to minimize the delays and increase sales.
## Set Clear Expectations
* Improve communication with customers regarding expected delivery times and any potential delays.
* Provide real-time tracking updates to enhance customer confidence in the delivery process.
